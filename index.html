     <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
    appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
    physics.</p>
    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big
    Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
    course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
    the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
    jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
    not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

     <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
    that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
     <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
    astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
    space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
    roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
    inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
     <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
    ever be proved.</p>
    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
    pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
    and speculation.</p>
    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
    billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
    unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
    eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
